Udacity Explore US Bikeshare Data Project
I created Explore US Bikeshare Data project in May. This project's script is written in Python 3. 

Description

In this project, i used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. My project compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
My code imports data from csv files and computes descriptive statistics from the data. It takes inputs from users to present statistics.

Files Used

chicago.csv
washington.csv
new_york_city.csv
